    - Weather: ${gameState.weather}
    - Temperature: ${gameState.temperature}째F
    - Moisture: ${gameState.moisture}%
    - Money: $${gameState.money}

    - Planted crops: ${farmAnalysis.plantedCount}/36 plots
    - Ready to harvest: ${farmAnalysis.readyCount}
    - Crop diversity: ${farmAnalysis.diversity} types

    Game mechanics:
    - Players manage a 6x6 grid (36 plots)
    - Weather affects crop growth and yields
    - Sensors improve yields
    - Loans are available with 1% daily interest
    
    Available crops:
    - Corn: 60-85째F, 60% moisture, $25 cost, $100 value, 3 days growth
    - Wheat: 55-75째F, 40% moisture, $15 cost, $75 value, 2 days growth
    - Tomato: 65-90째F, 75% moisture, $35 cost, $150 value, 4 days growth

    Whether the player is asking about farming or just chatting, be friendly and natural in your responses.
    If they ask about farming, include specific advice based on their current farm conditions.`;
