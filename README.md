# Smart Farm Simulator 🌾

A sophisticated farming simulation game built for the AWS Game Builder Challenge. Manage your farm, optimize crop yields, and make strategic decisions based on weather conditions and market prices.

## 🎮 Game Features

### Core Mechanics
- Interactive farming grid system with multiple crop types
- Dynamic weather simulation affecting crop growth
- Economic system with loans and maintenance costs
- Sensor placement for improved crop management
- AI-powered farm advisor using Amazon Bedrock (upcoming)

### Crop Management
- Three crop types with unique characteristics:
  - 🌽 Corn: Hardy crop with moderate water needs
  - 🌾 Wheat: Fast-growing and drought-resistant
  - 🍅 Tomato: High-value crop requiring careful management

### Environmental System
- Dynamic weather patterns (sunny, rainy, windy)
- Temperature and moisture tracking
- Crop yields affected by environmental conditions

### Economic Features
- Sophisticated pricing system
- Loan management with interest
- Sensor maintenance costs
- Investment opportunities in farm technology

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Frontend
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons

### AWS Integration (Planned)
- Amazon Bedrock for AI farm advisor
- Amazon DynamoDB for game state persistence
- AWS Lambda for game logic
- Amazon Cognito for user authentication
- Amazon S3 for game assets
- AWS AppSync for real-time updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- AWS Account (for full features)
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/smart-farm-simulator.git
cd smart-farm-simulator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## 🎯 Game Strategy

### Tips for Success
- Monitor weather conditions for optimal planting times
- Invest in sensors early for better crop yields
- Manage loans carefully to avoid excessive interest
- Diversify crops to minimize risk
- Use the AI advisor for strategic guidance

### Optimal Conditions
| Crop   | Temp Range | Water Needs | Growth Time |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Corn   | 60-85°F    | 60%         | 3 days      |
| Wheat  | 55-75°F    | 40%         | 2 days      |
| Tomato | 65-90°F    | 75%         | 4 days      |
